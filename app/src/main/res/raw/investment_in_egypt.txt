<b><u>A WELL-DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY THAT IS RESILIENT TO EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SHOCKS : </b></u>
Diversity is a key strength in the Egyptian economy where growth is driven by many sectors, both conventional and unconventional. This enhances the economy’s ability to absorb internal as well as external shocks. It also presents multiple opportunities for investors across many sectors.
The Egyptian economy’s ability to post positive real economic growth rates amid the global economic downturn as well as during the political unrest that prevailed in 2011-2013 indicates how resilient economic activity in Egypt is. This growth was mainly supported by household consumption which makes up more than 80% of GDP. Egypt’s steady population growth is also an intrinsic driver for economic growth; providing a large and growing consumption base and a buffer to economic activity at times of crisis.

<b><u>POLITICAL TRANSITION IS PROGRESSING STEADILY, OPENING THE WAY FOR A STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY : </b></u>
On the political front, Egypt is progressing with confidence towards building its democratic institutions and political system. After the ratification of the new constitution in January 2014 through a public referendum with 98.1% approval rate and the election of a new President in June 2014 through direct elections. The Parliamentary election law; the final prerequisite for holding the elections, was ratified by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in December 2014. Accordingly, Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place over two phases, in March and April 2015, completing the political transition that started on July 3, 2013.

<b><u>A PARADIGM SHIFT IN FISCAL POLICY</b></u>
Egypt has recently adopted a bold and ambitious reform plan to ensure fiscal sustainability and solve macroeconomic imbalances with the objective of reducing economic risk and bolstering confidence among investors.

The reform plan aims at increasing tax base, streamlining spending on fuel and electricity subsidies, leveraging capital spending and allocating more resources to public services and social security. These reforms led to subsequent upgrades to Egypt’s sovereign credit rating by the international rating agencies as well as positive feedback from the international financial institutions.

<b><u>MORE FLEXIBLE MONETARY MANAGEMENT</b></u>
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is responding swiftly to Egypt’s changing macroeconomic conditions through dynamic management of the foreign exchange and debt markets. The CBE has gradually devalued the Egyptian pound in 2013-2015 to better reflect market fundamentals and boost the competitiveness of the economy.
Moreover, the CBE used balanced and well-timed policy interventions; by changing official interest rates, to balance between keeping inflation within reasonable range and stimulate economic activity.
<b><u>UNEQUALED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIVATE DIRECT INVESTMENTS</b></u>
The Egyptian economy is becoming more reliant on private investments over time. Private sector’s share in total investments increased from 50% in 2002 to 62.2% in 2013/14 indicating a maintained policy commitment to enhance private sector’s role in the economy. Leveraging investments into infrastructure is one of the top priorities of the government’s economic agenda, which will enable private investors to access new sectors and markets.

Though private investments are significant in most sectors, there’s still a strong potential for higher private investments especially in previously untapped sectors.

The renewable power sector is a one example where the government encourages more private sector investments by introducing a rewarding feed-in tariff structure.

<b><u>A BOOMING STOCK MARKET</b></u>
Over the 10 year period from 2004 to 2014 the EGX30 witnessed a simple average return of 21% per annum and has outperformed this average consecutively in its’ last 3 years. One of the more interesting aspects illustrated in the above chart is the phenomena of decoupling which occurred in 2013. In 2011’s revolution the EGX30 declined by -49% yet in 2013’s revolution the index climbed 24%. Decoupling entails higher tolerance to, and lower correlation with, political events and social unrest as the Egyptian capital markets become de-synthesized to political shocks.

Perhaps most strikingly is Egypt’s ability to re-bound and recover as demonstrated by the EGX30’s ability to record positive gains of 51% and 32% in the post-revolution years in 2012 and 2014 respectively.
On the sectorial front, and although 2014 witnessed higher returns than 2013, only the Financial Services sector recorded negative returns in 2013 whereas Travel & Leisure, Telecommunications, Chemicals, Basic Resources and Food & Beverages sectors recorded negative results in 2014. Despite counterintuitive, this is predominantly due to the high performance of the Banks and Financial Services indices sectors in 2014, which outperformed their preceding 2013 returns. These sectors and their representative companies contribute significantly to EGX30 index weights.

<b><u>A FOCUS ON MEGA PROJECTS AND ENERGY SUFFICIENCY</b></u>
The Egyptian State has embarked on a number of national large-scale projects that aim at enhancing the competitiveness of the economy, creating employment opportunities and attracting foreign and domestic private investments. The Suez Canal Development Project (SCDP) capitalizes on Egypt’s strategic location at a crossroads for international trade. It includes expanding the capacities of a number of existing sea ports, establishing large-scale logistics areas and state-of-the-art industrial zones.
The project will position Egypt as a regional and international industry and trade hub. The targeted industries include, but not limited to, logistics, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles and ship building and maintenance. It will also benefit from the ongoing expansion of the Suez Canal, whereby a 72 km long parallel is expected to significantly cut transit time and increase daily traffic.

In addition to large scale industrial projects, the government is developing 15 new roads with a total distance of 3200 KMs to ensure improve connectivity and facilitate the movement of goods and services across the different governorates. This will help improve the economics of many industries and allow investors to access new internal and external markets.

Over the past 5 years, annual oil and gas production grew on average by 1% compared to annual average consumption growth of 5.3%. Hence, bridging the energy supply/demand gap became at the forefront of Egypt’s economic reform agenda, which includes a 5-year plan to increase energy efficiency by 10-15% with estimated annual savings of USD 6-8 bn.
